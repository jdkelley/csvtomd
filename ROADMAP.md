# Roadmap

## While WIP

* Add some actual flags
    * filename ending to add (Like `_table` or something`) (-z)`)
    * addFileEnding
    * Seperator
* Add install.sh for `curl|bash` install.
* fix install location issue (either leave it up to the user or install in a more acceptable place like ~/bin)

----

## Longer term

* Fix SEPARATOR Problem.
* Write this in a "real" language. I'm trying to decide between python, go, or rust.

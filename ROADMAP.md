# Roadmap

## While WIP

* Actual flags
    * help
    * File should be main argument
    * filename ending to add (Like `_table` or something`)
* Install
* Uninstall
* Update


----

## Longer term

* Write this in a "real" language. I'm trying to decide between python, go, or rust.
* Fix SEPARATOR Problem.
